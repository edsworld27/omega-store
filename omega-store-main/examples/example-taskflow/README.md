# Ω EXAMPLE PROJECT — "TaskFlow" (A Simple Task Manager)

**This folder shows what a completed Omega project looks like.** Every seed file is filled in, all governance files are populated, and the project is at Phase 01 — ready for CP-3 (PRD Review).

**Purpose:** Reference only. Copy this folder and adapt it to your project.

## What "TaskFlow" Is

A simple web-based task manager where users can create, organise, and complete tasks. It has a Next.js frontend, a Supabase backend, and deploys to Vercel. It's deliberately simple so the **framework structure** is the focus, not the project complexity.

## How This Example Was Built

1. Filled in `CONTEXT.md` with TaskFlow's definition
2. Chose "Web Application" → activated SaaS Kit
3. Filled in supporting seeds (BRAND, TECH_STACK, PERSONAS, etc.)
4. Ran the Ignition Prompt → agent bootstrapped the project
5. Agent generated governance files at CP-1
6. Agent is now at CP-3 — waiting for PRD approval
