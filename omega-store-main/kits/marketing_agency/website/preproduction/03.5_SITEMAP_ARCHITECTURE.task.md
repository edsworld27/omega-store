# TASK: SITEMAP & ARCHITECTURE

This task formalizes the hierarchical structure of the website before any component logic is written.

## Objectives
- [ ] **Global Navigation:** Define the Main Menu layout (e.g., Logo | Services - About - Contact | CTA Button).
- [ ] **Footer Map:** Define the bottom-tier navigation (Legal links, secondary pages, socials).
- [ ] **Page Tree:** List every required page and its hierarchical depth (e.g., `/` -> `/services/` -> `/services/web-design`).
- [ ] **Slug Definition:** Lock in the URL slugs for all pages.
- [ ] **Tech Integration Points:** Map where specific technologies touch the sitemap (e.g., `/contact` -> Webhook Form; `/blog` -> CMS route).

## Evidence Required
- [ ] `SITEMAP.md` documenting the finalized page tree and integration points.
