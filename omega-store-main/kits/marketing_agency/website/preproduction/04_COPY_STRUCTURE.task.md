# TASK: COPYWRITING & LANDING FRAMEWORK

We define the message and the persuasion architecture before any visual design.

## Objectives
- [ ] **Landing Page Framework:** Define the "Persuasion Stack" for the Home/Landing pages (Hero -> Social Proof -> Problem -> Solution -> FAQ -> CTA).
- [ ] **Copywriting Structure:** Write the high-resolution copy for critical pages. No "Lorem Ipsum".
- [ ] **Micro-Copy Audit:** Define the text for buttons, error labels, and success messages to ensure brand consistency.
- [ ] **CTA Optimization:** Craft compelling, action-oriented CTAs based on the "Buying States" identified in step 02.

## Evidence Required
- [ ] `CONTENT_DRAFT.md` containing all page copy.
- [ ] Approved Page Frameworks.
