## Activation Flow

```
1. User runs RUN.md or ignition prompt
2. AI loads constitution (mandatory)
3. AI reads user-input/seed/PROJECT.md
4. AI detects: Project Type = Website
5. AI loads this kit:
   └── First: PROMPTER.md (discovery)
   └── Then: WEBSITE_KIT.md (patterns)
   └── Then: phase folders (tasks)
6. PROMPTER.md drives the conversation
7. Build begins only when requirements table is complete
```
