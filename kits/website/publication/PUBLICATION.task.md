# PUBLICATION / FINALIZATION — Website Kit

This phase handles the transition from a "Verified Build" to a "Live Public Asset".

## Critical Finalization Tasks
- [ ] **SSL Verification:** Confirm HTTPS is active and forced via 301 redirects.
- [ ] **DNS Audit:** Verify A/AAAA and CNAME records are optimized for global delivery.
- [ ] **Sitemap & Robots:** Confirm `sitemap.xml` and `robots.txt` are live and indexed.
- [ ] **Sterile Project Cleanliness:** Audit the `project/` folder. Ensure NO dev-scaffolding, NO hidden git files, and NO source maps exist in the production bundle.
- [ ] **Handoff Generation:** Run the `HANDOFF.md` template. Provide credentials (securely), architecture overview, and maintenance SOPs.

## Knowledge Grounding
- [ ] Store proven patterns in the Hive/Store vault.
- [ ] Update project changelog with the "Production v1.0" stamp.
