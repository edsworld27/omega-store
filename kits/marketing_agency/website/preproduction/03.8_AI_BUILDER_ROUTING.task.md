# TASK: AI BUILDER ROUTING (V0 / LOVABLE)

*This task activates ONLY if the User selected "AI Builder Routing" during discovery.*

## Phase 1: Delegation (Prompt Engineering)
The Omega AI assumes the role of Architect, delegating the heavy visual scaffolding to an external UI generator.

- [ ] **Generate Core Prompt:** Based on the approved PRD, wireframe, and `AESTHETIC_LAYER.xml`, rewrite the requirements into a hyper-specific, massive prompt formatted specifically for Lovable or v0.
- [ ] **Mandate Laws:** The prompt MUST explicitly command the external builder to follow "Mobile-First Scaling" (rem/em) and "Flex/Grid Container" architecture.
- [ ] **Handoff:** Present the generated prompt to the User and wait.
    - *Example:* "Please paste this prompt into Lovable. Once it finishes generating the React code, paste the files/components back into this IDE."

## Phase 2: Ingestion & "The Hammer" (Constitutional Audit)
Once the external code is returned to the local IDE, Omega switches from Architect to "The Hammer."

- [ ] **Ingest External Code:** Create the local `.jsx`/`.tsx` files.
- [ ] **Audit Pass (WS-ACC-4):** Scan all CSS/Tailwind classes. Rip out absolute `px` values and replace with `rem/em` for mobile-first scaling.
- [ ] **Audit Pass (WS-PERF-3):** Rip out broken/fixed positioning and replace with robust `flex` or `grid` containers.
- [ ] **Security Sweep:** Verify the external code doesn't contain bad practices, `dangerouslySetInnerHTML` without sanitization, or unhandled prop drilling.
- [ ] **Integration:** Wire the cleaned component into the local routing and logic framework.

## Evidence Required
- [ ] The generated Lovable/v0 Prompt.
- [ ] List of "Hammering Fixes" applied to the external code upon ingestion.
