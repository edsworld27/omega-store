# TASK: MARKET AUDIT (BRAND & COMPETITORS)

This is the first step of the professional website build lifecycle. We establish the identity and the competitive landscape.

## Objectives
- [ ] **Brand Genesis:** Define the core values, tone of voice, visual identity (colors/typology), and unique value proposition (UVP).
- [ ] **Competitor Mapping:** Identify at least 3 direct and 2 indirect competitors.
- [ ] **SWOT Evaluation:** Analyze competitor strengths, weaknesses, and market gaps we can exploit.
- [ ] **Market Positioning:** Define precisely where this brand sits in the market (e.g., Premium vs. Accessible, Disruptor vs. Established).

## Evidence Required
- [ ] Project-specific `BRAND_BIBLE.md`.
- [ ] Competitor audit table in `preproduction/research/`.
