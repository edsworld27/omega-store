# CONTENT — TaskFlow

**Purpose:** Minimal — TaskFlow is an app, not a content-heavy website. This covers the landing page and in-app copy.

---

## Landing Page
| Section | Content |
| :--- | :--- |
| Hero H1 | "Get things done. Simply." |
| Hero subtext | "The task manager for people who hate task managers." |
| CTA | "Start Free — No Credit Card" |
| Features | 1. Create tasks in seconds 2. Organise by project 3. Share with your team |
| Social proof | "Used by X freelancers and small teams" (update post-launch) |

## In-App Copy Tone
- Keep it short — no tooltip should be more than one sentence
- Use active verbs: "Add task", "Mark complete", "Delete project"
- Empty states should be helpful, not sad: "No tasks yet — add one to get started"
- Error messages should say what to do, not what went wrong: "Try again" not "Error 500"
