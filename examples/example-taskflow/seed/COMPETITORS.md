## Direct Competitors
| Name | URL | What They Do Well | What They Do Badly | Price Point |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |

## Indirect Competitors
| Name | Their Approach | Why Users Choose Them |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| Apple Notes | Free, always available | Zero friction — but no task structure |
| Notion | All-in-one workspace | Power users love it — but overwhelming for simple tasks |
| Trello | Kanban boards | Visual — but boards don't scale well for personal tasks |

## Our Differentiation
- Zero learning curve — list-based, not board-based
- Free for individuals, cheap for small teams
- No feature bloat — we do tasks and nothing else

## Features to Match
- Due dates and reminders (table stakes)
- Priority levels (must have)
- Simple project/folder grouping

## Features to Skip
- Calendar view (defer to v2)
- Time tracking (never — anti-bloat)
- AI task suggestions (never — keep it deterministic)
